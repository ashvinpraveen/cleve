# Hello! I'm Ashvin
I don't really know how to code, but over 10 days I'm trying to build a simple AI app.

Simple might be an understatement, but we'll see how things go ðŸ˜†

I've got a group of friends on discord who are helping me out, so that's pretty cool.

yeah quite a rambly README, will probably update as the project goes on.

### Day 1:
Installed node.js (and Next.JS I think)
Got a basic app structure setup for the backend (based on Next.js)

### Day 2:
Trying to get the API connection working
Testing with PostMan
Learning a bit more about how API's and backend stuff works.

### Day 3:
Hello!

Realised I was using Next previously so here's a new project with Node instead.

Still trying to get the API connection to work
